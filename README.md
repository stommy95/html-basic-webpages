# Basic Web Pages Homework

After you set up your coding environment by following James' Introduction, follow along with his Basic Web Pages activity.

Yet, before you start this activity,

1. Review this [Github Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) about how to
  1. **Fork** this repository,
  2. **Clone** the Forked repo,
  3. After making changes to the code, **pushing** those changes to your Cloned code, and
  4. Submit this Clone as a **Pull Request** to the course organization's original repo.

You will follow this process, and on step 3, you will add your individual HTML file to the repo, as James instructs in the Basic Webpages chapter. **Be sure to name this new file “<code>basic-lastname.html</code>”**, where "lastname" will be your last name. For example, my homework file would be named "<code>basic-lindgren.html</code>"
