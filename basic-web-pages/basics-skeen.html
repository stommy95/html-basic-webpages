    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the ouline of your site. There are six levels of headins.</p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>NOtice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
      </ol>
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly empahsize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
